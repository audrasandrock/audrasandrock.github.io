	      <h3> "The Edge of Distinction" </h3>
		  <center><p>A new Concept in Concrete Edging<br>

Creating a clean and beautiful environment around your home or business is important. <br>
The way you and your guests feel about your surroundings is influenced largely by landscaping.<br>
Quality Curb, Inc. offers an innovative approach to landscape borders that brings a higher <br>
level of detail and beauty to your landscape design. Clean and creative lines are important <br>
to the overall layout of your landscaping. Quality Curb, Inc.'s concrete borders are the most durable,<br> 
cost-effective, and attractive borders you can find. Our borders mold and bend <br>
to the unique shapes that best suit your landscaping ideas. No border can give such a clean and<br> 
professional look. Concrete curbing is more durable than brick and comes in many <br>
different styles, colors, and textures.<br><br>

Quality Curb, Inc. is an extruded curb company. We have been installing concrete curbs for<br>
landscaping and parking lots since 1998.<br>

The process of our extruded concrete curbing is done either by an electric or gas driven machine. <br>
The curbing mix is compacted through the use of a machine with a mechanically driven ram <br>
into a slip-form for extrusion into final structural design of the curbing border. <br>
Our unique process allows installation to be fast, clean and less expensive than traditional methods.<br>

Quality Curb, Inc. is happy to give you a limited One-Year Warranty against settlement cracks. <Br>
	We hope that you will like your new look, and thank you for choosing Quality Curb, Inc.<br></center>

	      <h3>Installation</h3>
		  <p> 

The sod cutting and ground preparation is completed first making the landscape ready for curb installation. <br>
This is done using a sod-cutting machine to cut an approx. 12" wide strip of sod about 1-2 inches deep, <br>
and the crew using flat nose shovels to remove the grass, and then leveling the ground. <br>
Once the ground preparation is completed we are ready for installation. We do ask that you identify any<br> 
telephone or cable lines running in the area to be curbed.<br>
The concrete is then mixed on a self-contained trailer, and if color is desired it is added <br>
to the exact measurement for the job. The mixture of concrete sand, Portland cement, and <br>
reinforced fibers is what creates our strong durable curb. Once the concrete is mixed it is <br>
wheeled to the site, fed into the curbing machine and extruded into a continuous border for your <br>
landscaped area. The crew will then finish out and beautify the curb depending on the type of curb <br>
you are installing, either using trowels or a stamping process to finish the installation. As an <br>
added precaution to ground movement, control joints are cut into the curb approximate every 12-18 <br>
inches to add flexibility to a very strong reinforced curb.<br>
The installation of your curb is a 1-day process, and when the crew is completed your landscape <br>
will be as clean, or cleaner, than when they arrived.<br>

(When we provide your written estimate, we will show you a photo story book that describes the <br>
following steps. We also will be proud to show you photos of our recently completed jobs to help <br>
you decide on layouts and designs for your curbing.)</p>

	      <h3>Projects</h3>
		  <p>Due to the increase in building material costs after hurricane Katrina and<br>
		  the increased gasoline prices, we are forced to increase our prices for the first time<br>
		  since 2003. (Updated July, 2007)<br><br>

Natural (Plain concrete) Mowers Edge <br>
$5.00 to $6.25 per linear foot<br><bR>

Single Color Mowers Edge <br>
$5.50 to $6.75 per linear foot<br><br>

Natural (Plain concrete) 4" X 6" $5.75 to $7.50 per linear foot<br>
Natural (Plain Concrete) 6" X 6" $6.25 to $8.00 per linear foot<br>
Single Color (add .25-.50/linear foot)<br>
Note to previous customers: We will provide repairs or replacement of all our curbing due to damages<br>
caused by hurricane Katrina or clean-up activities @ $1.00 per foot less than the current rate per <br>
linear foot posted above. Please call us for written estimates for insurance purposes.<br>
Price differentials shown above are primarily based on size of job, number of runs, length of runs<br>
and the number of breaks needed to enhance the layout of the curbing.<br><br>

We are very competitively priced and will underbid any written estimate for landscape borders,<br>
residential or commercial, on the Northshore.<br><br>

We have other patterns (molds) available and can supply good local references for other tasks.<br>

All of our work is performed using fiberglass fibers for durability. Jobs requiring rebar will require<br>
us to scope the job and see what the specifications are before determining the final price per project.<br>

Call today for us to come out and give you a WRITTEN ESTIMATE!<br>
